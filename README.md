# PgFuncall

TODO: Write a gem description

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pg_funcall'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pg_funcall

This gem is currently only tested with ActiveRecord 4.0.x. There have been some changes with
type mapping in 4.1 which are likely to break it. The right answer is just to remove that
dependency altogether.
